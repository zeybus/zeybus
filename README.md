## Hi there 👋

## Zeynep Busra Sahin here!

### Get to know me;
I am from Turkey, living in Munich, Germany since 2021 April. 
I have B.A in Psychology and Sociology, and I am enrolled to an M.A. program, called Applied Social Research.
Currently I am a ReDi School student in Introduction to Computer Science course.

<b><i> My motivation; <i><b><br /> 

I have become a student in ReDi as I want to change my career path from pure theory of social sciences to application to everyday life.
I want to know more about computer language and data collection, and at last, data analysis.
I wish to know more about supervised and unsupervised machine learning, beginning with regression analysis.
My initial aim is to transfer my old school statistics knowlegde to contemporary applications.

### Computer Skills;
 I have learnt SPSS in my MA class (Advanced Statistics).
I studied Python individually using courses on Udemy.
